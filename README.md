## Description
Midnight Hauntings is an escape and stealth style game. The central objective of the game is to escape the cemetery before the clock hits 3:00, but this task will not be so simple, as you will have to be very cautious and escape without the hauntings seeing you.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to be able to pass through all the cemeteries and deposit the blood in the engravings without being noticed, in order to keep the witch imprisoned in the underworld.

## Story
A city legend says that every 30 years a witch rises from the dead to destroy the city. At midnight on Halloween, the witch's liberation ritual begins to take place in the city's cemeteries. An army of haunting creatures emerges to protect the ritual. The ritual is carried out in each cemetery in the city, and ends at 3 am. If the ritual succeeds, the witch is freed and the monsters invade the city, causing chaos and destruction. The witch's first appearance was in 1754, and since then, a group of guardians from several generations have been fighting to keep her imprisoned. The guardians are descendants of the first guardians. These used their blood to seal the witch in the underworld. And since then, only people with traces of the first guardians' blood can prevent her from being freed. Not all descendants of the guardians possess the ability to reseal the opening between the lower world and the upper world. Only those who have a recessive trait in their DNA. In order to seal the opening, the guardians need to enter each cemetery in the city without being noticed, and deposit their blood on the engraving. If they are noticed, the witch's army will notice the presence of the guardians and the plan will go down the drain.
