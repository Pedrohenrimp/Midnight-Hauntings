## Story
A city legend says that every 30 years a witch rises from the dead to destroy the city. At midnight on Halloween, the witch's liberation ritual begins to take place in the city's cemeteries. An army of haunting creatures emerges to protect the ritual. The ritual is carried out in each cemetery in the city, and ends at 3 am. If the ritual succeeds, the witch is freed and the monsters invade the city, causing chaos and destruction. The witch's first appearance was in 1754, and since then, a group of guardians from several generations have been fighting to keep her imprisoned. In order to seal the opening, the guardians need to enter each cemetery in the city without being noticed, collect all potions and deposit in the caldron. If they are noticed, the plan will go down the drain.
